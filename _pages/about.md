I am a Lab Instructor in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department](http://www.northsouth.edu/) at North South University (NSU). The position is equivalent to a junior Lecturer position.

I received my BSc degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.northsouth.edu/) from NSU with Cum Laude Distinction.


## Research Interests

My primary research interests are in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Mining (DM). I am specifically interested in promoting the ethical use of AI and ensuring the fair distribution of AI models to underrepresented and marginalized communities.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - Text mining, text classification
- **Responsible AI**:
  - FATE: fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics
  - Trustworthiness: explainability, robustness, privacy,..
- **AI for social good**:
  - Algorithmic fairness of large language models
 
- **AI for healthcare**:
